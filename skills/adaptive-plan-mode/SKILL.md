# Adaptive Plan Mode

Read first. Change later.

Goal: highest-confidence solution, least unnecessary **ceremony** — not max analysis, not max speed. Match depth to task: a tiny bug fix earns light reasoning, a cross-service migration earns deep investigation.

Every technical claim traces to evidence — inspected code, logs, tests, docs, tool output, or the user. If a core assumption fails mid-plan, stop, discard the reasoning built on it, and rebuild from what's verified.

Delegate separable investigation (dependency tracing, API research, edge-case exploration) to sub-agents when it keeps the main thread focused — brief template: [SUBAGENT-BRIEF.md](SUBAGENT-BRIEF.md). Don't delegate work small enough to just do yourself.

---

# Phase 1 — Understand the Real Problem

Call `EnterPlanMode` before any investigation or planning begins — switches a Plan/Execute model split (e.g. `opusplan`) onto the planning model, makes the approval gate real. Skip it and every later phase runs on whatever model the session already had.

Before touching tools, work out:

- **What is being asked?** Restate the request in one sentence.
- **What is the real goal?** The visible request may hide a deeper problem ("add retries" → reliability; "slow endpoint" → scaling bottleneck; "refactor module" → maintainability pain).
- **What is out of scope?**
- **What constraints matter?** — latency, throughput, memory, compatibility, migrations, rollback safety, deployment sequencing, cost, observability, developer ergonomics.

Done when: problem, goal, scope, and constraints are stated in your own words. If ambiguity blocks progress, ask one focused clarifying question before moving on.

---

# Phase 2 — Investigate the System

Investigate before proposing implementation: code ownership and structure, callers/consumers, data model and migrations, concurrency, existing conventions, error handling, performance-sensitive paths, tests and fixtures, feature flags, rollout patterns, operational history, third-party constraints.

Before spawning anything, break the investigation into its independent sub-questions (ownership, callers, data model, tests, …) — one broad agent sent to "explore everything" is no different from doing it yourself, so never issue one. Spawn one targeted agent per sub-question, all in a single message so they run concurrently; a task with only one real sub-question earns only one agent. Default `agentType: caveman:cavecrew-investigator` per targeted lookup (read-only, output pre-compressed — keeps the main thread's context cheap). Reach for `agentType: feature-dev:code-explorer` instead when a sub-question needs a full architecture/dependency map before an approach can be chosen.

For a hard bug with several plausible root causes and no way to rule one out from code alone, propose an [agent team](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) to the user instead — teammates test competing hypotheses in parallel and challenge each other's findings, which no sub-agent (report-back-only) can do. Ask before spawning: experimental, needs `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`, and costs meaningfully more tokens than sub-agents.

Stop when a new fact could no longer flip the chosen approach. Digging further for its own sake is ceremony too.

---

# Phase 3 — Evaluate Like a Senior Engineer

Go through all seven dimensions — correctness, failure modes, scale & performance, operational safety, maintainability, security, testing — mark each relevant or not, one line why. Full checklist: [EVALUATION.md](EVALUATION.md) — open for security-sensitive, failure-mode-heavy, or unfamiliar-domain work; skip only when every relevant dimension is already obvious from Phase 2 evidence.

Evaluate what the evidence says is actually at risk — not hypothetical bottlenecks or manufactured edge cases nobody will hit.

Done when: all seven dimensions are accounted for and every one marked relevant has been checked against actual evidence, not assumption.

---

# Phase 4 — Compare Alternatives

Generate every approach that's a real fork in the road, investigated, never faked to hit a count. Most tasks have one — say so and move on. When 2-3 genuinely compete, compare them on correctness, implementation complexity, operational cost, blast radius, reversibility, and long-term maintenance burden.

Done when: one approach is chosen and every losing alternative has a one-line reason.

If the chosen approach still rests on unconfirmed assumptions — scope, priorities, risk tolerance, a tradeoff between alternatives — invoke the `grilling` skill to grill the user before drafting the plan. Runs on investigated evidence instead of guesses now; cheaper to settle here than discard a written plan built on a wrong premise.

If the fork itself is still open after that — an architecture or technology choice, codebase evidence alone can't settle it, and it's hard to revert — spawn `agentType: oryna` here to get an evidence-researched verdict before committing to an approach. This is for the fork, not the plan: oryna is expensive and OSS-research-heavy, wrong tool for reviewing an already-decided plan (that's Phase 6's job).

# Phase 5 — Produce the Plan

```md
## Problem
<what is happening and why it matters>

## Constraints & Assumptions
- <verified constraint>

## Key Findings
- <important discoveries>
- <surprises>
- <unknowns>

## Proposed Approach
<recommended solution and rationale>

### Alternatives Considered
- <alternative> — rejected because <reason>

## Risks & Edge Cases
- <risk> — <mitigation>

## Implementation Plan
1. <module/file> — <change>
2. <module/file> — <change>

## Execution Skills
- <skill-name> — <when/why during Phase 7>, or "None" if no other skill applies

## Tests
- <coverage strategy>

No ceremony.

Done when: every section has evidence-backed content — no placeholders left.

# Trivial Gate

Gates the opus review in both Phase 6 (plan) and Phase 8 (diff). A plan or diff is trivial only if ALL of these hold — any fail means not trivial:

- touches exactly 1 file
- diff ≤ 15 lines
- no change to a public API, exported signature, or documented behavior
- does not touch config, migrations, auth/security paths, CI, or build files
- reversible with a single `git revert`

Any line uncertain to call — treat it as failed.

---

# Phase 6 — Get Approval

Once the plan (Phase 5) is ready: spawn a review agent on model `opus`, `agentType: Plan` — fresh eyes on the plan, catching gaps before the human reads it — and fold its findings in. If a `planship-mode` reminder for a mode other than `normal` is in context, use the model and effort it specifies instead of `opus` at default effort. Exception: if the plan passes every line of the Trivial Gate, you may re-read it yourself instead — the human approval gate immediately below backstops this case. Done when: the plan reflects the review's findings (or your own re-read), fixed or explicitly rejected.

Log the outcome: create `~/.claude/planship/` if needed, then append one UTF-8 line (`Add-Content -Encoding utf8` on Windows) to `~/.claude/planship/log.jsonl` — `{"ts":"<ISO-8601 UTC>","event":"plan","trivial":true}` if the Trivial Gate passed, `{"ts":"<ISO-8601 UTC>","event":"plan","trivial":false}` otherwise. Append-only, one line per plan, never rewrite or rotate the file.

Then call `ExitPlanMode` with the plan and wait for approval — this is the boundary where a Plan/Execute split switches to the execution model. Start implementing only after that call returns approved.

If the plan changes before or at that gate — human feedback, a revision request — revise it, then run the review again only when the change is material: a different approach, scope, or risk profile. Trivial edits (wording, a renamed variable, a dropped open question) skip the extra pass.

---

# Phase 7 — Execute

Before touching files, call `AskUserQuestion` with the current branch name as one option and "new branch" as the other — a blocking gate, not a rhetorical aside. Never create a branch until that call returns an answer. If new: branch count scales with the plan — one branch for the whole plan when it's a single unit of work; one per independently mergeable/revertable step when the Implementation Plan has parts that stand on their own.

Follow the approved plan: invoke the Execution Skills it names as each applies, keep changes small and reviewable, match existing abstractions instead of introducing new ones, verify assumptions continuously, update the plan if reality changes materially.

Done when: the change matches the plan and is verified working (tests pass, or drive the flow per the `verify` skill) — then move to Phase 8.

---

# Phase 8 — Independent Review

Invoke the `code-review` skill — fresh eyes, no stake in the plan or the code just written — before reporting done. Point it at the merge-base for the branch; it checks the diff on two axes — Spec (does the diff match the Phase 5 plan) and Standards (does it match this codebase's existing conventions) — and flags what the implementing pass missed on either. It's not the quality gate; Phase 7's own test/build run is. Don't ask it to verify what it can't execute.

Skip this review only when BOTH hold: (1) the diff passes every line of the Trivial Gate, and (2) an automated check that exercises the changed lines passed in Phase 7 — an existing test, or a small runnable check that fails on the pre-change code for a behavior change. A check that would've passed either way proves nothing; re-reading your own diff counts as neither.

Done when: the review agent has returned and each finding is either fixed or named to the user as an accepted risk.

Log the outcome: append one UTF-8 line to `~/.claude/planship/log.jsonl` — `{"ts":"<ISO-8601 UTC>","event":"review","findings":<N>}`, N = number of findings the review returned (0 if none). This step ran → always log it, regardless of N.

---

# Phase 9 — Verify

This is the completion gate, not optional. Once Phase 8 is done, tell the user to run the `verify` skill — don't invoke it yourself. Nothing is "done" until they've run it and it has reported pass/fail.

Done when: `verify` has been run and any failure it reports is fixed or named to the user as an accepted risk.

Ready to ship? Tell the user the `ship-pr` skill can open the PR — don't invoke it yourself. Phase 7 produced more than one branch → tell the user to run `ship-pr` once per branch, in the dependency order the Implementation Plan laid out. Then move to Phase 10.

---

# Phase 10 — Improve this skill

See [`self-improve-after-running.md`](../self-improve-after-running.md).

Done when: the friction checklist there is checked — nothing to fix, or a diff was proposed and either applied or declined by Boss.
