name: ship-pr
description: Ship the current branch through its full PR/MR life cycle on GitHub or GitLab, from pre-PR review to merged-and-synced. Use when the user wants a branch shipped, merged, or opened as a PR/MR — e.g. "ship it", "tạo PR".
---

Ship current branch end to end via platform CLI (`gh` or `glab`). Nine steps, run in order; steps 5 and 6 loop.

## 1. Pick the repo and platform

`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` at cwd. Succeeds → that's the repo root, proceed below. Fails with "not a git repository" → cwd is a container folder sitting above several repos (a multi-repo workspace, one folder per microservice) rather than a repo itself.

On that failure: list immediate subdirectories holding a `.git` (`find . -maxdepth 2 -name .git`, or PowerShell `Get-ChildItem -Directory -Depth 1 -Filter .git -Force`). Zero found → stop, tell Boss — nothing here is a git repo. One found → that's the repo, no question needed. Several found → Boss's request already naming a service (e.g. "ship payment-service") picks it by folder name, no question; otherwise list the candidate repo folders and ask Boss which one to ship. Every command in every step below then runs with that repo as cwd.

`git remote -v` inside the repo root. One platform in remotes → use it, no question. Remotes on **both** GitHub and GitLab → ask Boss which to ship through (list remotes found). Chosen platform decides CLI (`gh` for GitHub, `glab` for GitLab) and remote used for every push in later steps.

Shipping via GitLab → read [gitlab.md](gitlab.md) now for `glab` command mapping; steps below written in `gh` terms.

**CLI fallback:** chosen CLI failing for tool reasons — not installed, auth error, same command erroring twice — means switching to that platform's MCP tools for same operation (ToolSearch for github/gitlab tools). Neither CLI nor MCP works → stop and tell Boss.

Done when: exactly one repo root and exactly one platform + remote are locked in (Boss asked only when either was ambiguous).

## 2. One PR or several?

Skim branch against target base: `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline` and `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat`. One concern → step silent, move on. Diff mixing independent concerns (feature plus unrelated fix, two features, drive-by cleanup) → propose split to Boss: name each group with its files, let Boss pick one PR or several. Entangled groups (shared files, one needs other's code) ship together — stacked PRs are out of scope here.

On split: per group, branch off base (`git switch -c <group-branch> <base>`) and carry that group's changes over — cherry-pick when commits map one-to-one to groups, otherwise `git checkout <work-branch> -- <paths>` and commit. Then ship serially: run steps 3–8 to completion for one branch before starting next — later steps switch checkouts, so interleaving tangles them. Delete original mixed branch only after every group has merged.

Done when: Boss confirmed a single PR, or every group sits on its own branch and the groups together cover the whole original diff, with a shipping order agreed.

## 3. Self-review before opening

Skip this step entirely when `adaptive-plan-mode` already ran its Phase 8 review and Phase 9 verify on this exact diff, with no commits since — say so and move to step 4.

Invoke the `code-review` skill against `<base>` (base = the branch the PR will target). Fix every finding, or list the ones being waived and get Boss's explicit waive. This runs every time, even with reviewers and CI downstream.

Then, if the diff touches runtime surface (product source — anything beyond docs/tests), run the `verify` skill on the final state of the branch. Verify comes after review on purpose: review findings produce fixes, and the fixes are part of what gets verified.

Done when: every review finding is fixed or Boss-waived, and `verify` passed on the final code (or the diff had no runtime surface, or the step was skipped per above).

If `code-review` ran above (not skipped): log it. Create `~/.claude/planship/` if needed, then append one UTF-8 line (`Add-Content -Encoding utf8` on Windows) to `~/.claude/planship/log.jsonl` — `{"ts":"<ISO-8601 UTC>","event":"review","findings":<N>}`, N = number of findings returned (0 if none). Append-only, one line per run, never rewrite or rotate the file.

## 4. Open the PR

Check for existing PR on branch before creating one — verify none exists first: `gh pr list --head <branch> --state all --json number,state,url`.

- Nothing found → create one (`gh pr create`).
- Found, state OPEN → branch already shipped once, picked up more commits since; push them (`git push`), then skip straight to it with `gh pr view <num>`.
- Found, state MERGED → branch already merged; new commits need fresh PR against same base, not reopen. Tell Boss before creating one — usually means branch got reused instead of cut fresh.

Done when: you have a PR number, and it's open (not merged).

## 5. Wait for checks

```
gh pr checks <num> --watch --required
```

If it reports no checks found right after push, first tell apart two cases: repo has CI but checks haven't registered on GitHub's side yet (wait ~15s, retry — fresh push always lags), versus repo has no CI at all (no workflows in `.github/workflows/`, no `.gitlab-ci.yml`). Zero-CI repo → step is no-op: skip to step 6, note "no CI on this repo" at merge gate instead of retrying forever or reading empty result as pass. If `--required` errors on this repo, fall back to `gh pr checks <num> --watch` and only treat checks marked required in PR's branch protection as blocking.

If check fails: pull failing job's log (`gh run view --log-failed`), fix root cause, commit, push. Push re-enters this step — checks re-run on new commit.

If same check still red after 3 push-and-recheck rounds, stop — tell Boss which check, with log, instead of continuing to push blind fixes.

Done when: `gh pr checks --required` reports every required check green — or the repo was confirmed zero-CI.

## 6. Resolve review feedback

`gh pr view --json` has no `reviewThreads` field, its `comments` field misses inline review comments, and misses a review's own top-level `body` — read all three via GraphQL:

```
owner=$(gh repo view --json owner -q .owner.login)
repo=$(gh repo view --json name -q .name)
gh api graphql -f query='query($owner:String!,$repo:String!,$num:Int!){repository(owner:$owner,name:$repo){pullRequest(number:$num){reviewDecision reviews(first:20){nodes{state author{login} body submittedAt}} reviewThreads(first:100){nodes{id isResolved comments(first:10){nodes{body author{login}}}}} comments(first:100){nodes{body author{login}}}}}}' -F owner="$owner" -F repo="$repo" -F num=<num>
```

Three distinct surfaces, all easy to miss individually: `reviewThreads` covers inline review comments (attached to diff line); `reviews` covers a review's own top-level `body` (summary text a reviewer — bot or human — writes when submitting review, separate from any inline threads it created); top-level `comments` covers plain PR conversation comments (not attached to review or line). Check all three. Review with findings but no matching thread and no top-level comment usually means bot review got silently downgraded — see [review-edge-cases.md](review-edge-cases.md).

For each unresolved thread requesting change: fix and push — this re-enters step 5, since fix invalidates last check run. For thread that's a question: reply, then resolve it yourself with `resolveReviewThread` mutation (skip resolve only if project's convention is that thread's opener resolves it — then leave it open and report it at merge gate instead of blocking on it here). For plain comment or review `body` requesting change or raising blocking question: treat it same as thread — fix and push, or reply — then leave `gh pr comment` acknowledging it (neither has resolve state to clear).

Done when: `reviewDecision` isn't `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, every unresolved thread, every review `body`, AND every plain PR comment is either addressed or explicitly deferred to the merge gate, and this state was reached without a push happening in between (a push means step 5 first).

## 7. Merge — stop and confirm

Check mergeability:

```
gh pr view <num> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus
```

`mergeable` computed async — right after checks finish it can read `UNKNOWN`; wait few seconds, re-query rather than treating that as blocked.

Non-clean `mergeable`/`mergeStateStatus` → see [merge-edge-cases.md](merge-edge-cases.md) for the CONFLICTING/DIRTY, BEHIND, and BLOCKED branches.

Pick merge method: `gh repo view --json squashMergeAllowed,mergeCommitAllowed,rebaseMergeAllowed`. One method enabled → use it. Several enabled → ask Boss which, unless project's CLAUDE.md already states convention.

Merging hard to reverse, touches shared state — always stop, get explicit go-ahead from Boss before running merge, even with everything green. Show PR's check/review/mergeable status *and* commits pushed during steps 5–6 (`gh pr view <num> --json commits`), so Boss is approving what actually shipped, not a green checkmark.

Once confirmed:

```
gh pr merge <num> --<method> --delete-branch
```

Add `--admin` only for BLOCKED-bypass case above, and only after Boss confirmed it specifically.

`--delete-branch` deletes branch both locally and on remote, switches local checkout to base branch as part of that.

Done when: Boss explicitly said to proceed, and the merge command exits 0.

## 8. Sync

On multi-PR split with groups still unshipped: after this sync, check out next group's branch, re-enter step 3.

```
git pull
```

Done when: `git status` shows the default branch, clean, up to date with origin — and no split group remains unshipped.

## 9. Improve this skill

See [`self-improve-after-running.md`](../self-improve-after-running.md).

Done when: the friction checklist there is checked — nothing to fix, or a diff was proposed and either applied or declined by Boss.
